# LinuxTKS

## About
LinuxTKS is part of my Student Innvate Project during my schooling. It is required to create something innovative in order to graduate, thus came along the idea of creating a light weight toolkit for Linux for things that I overlooked in CCDC competitions.

## Current Known Issues
* [ ] Cannot remove file until one before that is removed
  * File/Directory Change Module, must add drop down 
* [x] Cannot kick or ban SSH user until one before that is
  * Added in a drop down option to select a SSH session to kick or ban 
* [ ] Must run as sudo or as root in order to kick or ban other users (linux permissions)

## Things to work on
* [x] Ban SSH by User
* [x] Ban SSH by connecting IP
* [x] Add in viewing of banned users and IPs
* [x] Add in option to remove users/IPs from ban list
* [ ] Add in an option to disable alerts
* [ ] Eventually create something for not GUI Linux builds that utilize same functions
